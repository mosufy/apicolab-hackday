# Demonstration Pitch

"Anyone here uses Tinder?" I'm sure the rest of you are too shy to own up but it's all good. I myself an "not" using Tinder.

Everybody loves to travel. Especially so fo Singaporeans. You know this is true when you own government made an official announcement not to travel.

Another fact is that Singaporeans are stingy when it comes to money. Scratch that, I mean are "value-conscious"

So let me introduce to you "Tinder for Cheape Flights"!

Simply enter the destination and origin country and let the app find for you the cheapest flights across a certain date-range. This app integrates with the SkyScanner API to auto-suggest the best-fit city or country based on your input. It then fetches the cheapest flight available across date range of about one-month from now.

Once the country is shown, simply "swipe right" if you may consider the suggestion, or "swipe left" to totally ignore or remove the option.

Using a learning algorithm, the app will pick out better and cheaper flight recommendations

You will also receive notification via push notification, SMS or email once better flight deals appear

When you found the perfect match, simply click the "Buy now" and it will bring it over to SkyScanner to complete your purchase.

Thank you.
